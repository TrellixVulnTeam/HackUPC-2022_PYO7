This results in features such as the hand start (I selected ´kick start´ as it was the most appropriate!) And the hand gear change (the gears being: first, forward and left; second, back and right; third, forward and right). The idea behind this was to prevent one´s shoes from becoming scuffed. A feature added to make the gear change supposedly easy is a sticky throttle: one that holds its plays without the spring returning it to the natural position of idle. Another feature - for the sake of comfort - is floorboards, complimented by large, aluminium leg shields. Especially given the layout of the boxer engine, this is a desirous feature in the winter, but not the summer! To provide storage, a small lunchbox is embedded into the top of the bike - just in front of the fuel filler cap. Many of the bikes were used by police services. These bikes are distinguishable by their ´police´ on the otherwise blank magneto cover, and a ´v´ shaped battery compartment to prevent water entering. To remove the engine/gearbox/swinging arm assembly, one has to remove the body and frame from it. Down to the low centre of gravity of the bike - from the nature of a boxer - it is a very easy bike to operate, and handle.
