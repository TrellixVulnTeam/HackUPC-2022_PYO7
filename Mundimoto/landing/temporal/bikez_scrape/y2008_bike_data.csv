New fork settings. Optimisation of the oil-flow has made the forks more sensitive in absorbing the bumps. 
New shockabsorber settings. More stable performance over time, combined with greater reliability. 
New Keihin PWK ø 28 mm carburettor: more immediate and lively response at the bottom end, together with a marked improvement in power and acceleration in the middle-to-upper range. 
New filter box to optimise the fit with the new Keihin carburettor: improved airflow thanks to a larger diameter sleeve. 
New crankcase. New design in the area of the connection between barrel and crankcase has reduced crank chamber volume with a nett increase in smoothness at low revs. 
New cylinder head design (on the 250 and the 270cc) ensures more regular carburation when shutting the throttle and provides greater engine torque. 
New single-chamber silencer (270cc only): smooths out the power delivery at low engine speeds making it even more linear, and provides a noticeable increase in power and acceleration at the top end. 
New main bearings: these ensure greater smoothness and reliability. 
New crankshaft oilseal: the reduction in friction has given the engine a cleaner response to the throttle. 
Euro3 homologation. 
New colour-scheme: a brand-new mix of white and fluorescent red.

This state-of-the-art, fuel injected, eight valve, DOHC, six speed V-twin develops 80-100 Hp depending on tuning and offers full response and power even at low revs. 

Brakes - Highly effective and sensitive Brembo or Braking brakes make sure that the margins are on your side. You can brake with full control on all surfaces. Two or four (depending on model) piston calipers at the front and single piston caliper at the rear. 

Front suspension - The Marzocchi 50 mm front fork offers long wheel travel and full damping adjustability (rebound and compression) that ensures you to make the most use of the powerful engine. 

Rear suspension - The Öhlin rear shock absorber provide 300 mm wheel travel, and is fully adjustable to suit any rider weight or riding condition. 

Gas tank - The 20 liter tank allows you to ride for hours without needing to stop. It is rotation-moulded in impact-resistant polyethylene and integrated in the frame which helps to lower the centre of gravity. 

Frame - The extremely rigid frame design in rectangular CrMo steel profile gives a stable ride with total road feedback. It is unique in its simplicity and easy to dismantle for engine maintenance. 

Wheels - The rims are from Excel with billet machined aluminum hubs from Talon. This together with stainless steel spokes makes for the strongest wheels in the business. ",,Double Overhead Cams/Twin Cam (DOHC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New fork settings. Optimisation of the oil-flow has made the forks more sensitive in absorbing the bumps. 
New shockabsorber settings. More stable performance over time, combined with greater reliability. 
New Keihin PWK ø 28 mm carburettor: more immediate and lively response at the bottom end, together with a marked improvement in power and acceleration in the middle-to-upper range. 
New filter box to optimise the fit with the new Keihin carburettor: improved airflow thanks to a larger diameter sleeve. 
New crankcase. New design in the area of the connection between barrel and crankcase has reduced crank chamber volume with a nett increase in smoothness at low revs. 
New cylinder head design (on the 250 and the 270cc) ensures more regular carburation when shutting the throttle and provides greater engine torque. 
New single-chamber silencer (270cc only): smooths out the power delivery at low engine speeds making it even more linear, and provides a noticeable increase in power and acceleration at the top end. 
New main bearings: these ensure greater smoothness and reliability. 
New crankshaft oilseal: the reduction in friction has given the engine a cleaner response to the throttle. 
Euro3 homologation. 
New colour-scheme: a brand-new mix of white and fluorescent red.

New fork settings. Optimisation of the oil-flow has made the forks more sensitive in absorbing the bumps as well as more reactive on the rebound, to facilitate acrobatic manoeuvres or simple movements of the front wheel. 
New dedicated shockabsorber settings to suit the cycle parts and the power delivery of the 4-stroke engine. 
New electric fuel tap: more practical, results in better mechanical accessibility and increased reliability. 
New hot start knob integrated into the carburettor union: immediate and easy accessibility improves practicality in starting the engine from hot. It is also less cumbersome and less vulnerable to crash damage than the earlier lever on the handlebar. 
New pressure-cast casings: these provide optimised design at the bottom end of the bike, to make a better match with the stoneguard rubber and casing. 
New outer clutch cover with five-bolt fixing for a better seal. New position for the oil filler plug: improved access to facilitate maintenance operations. 
New design for the clutch cover with the addition of lateral grooves to facilitate removal of the clutch: greater practicality during maintenance. 
New exhaust pipe with reduced metal thickness (1 mm): greater performance under acceleration together with a substantial weight reduction (-150 grams). 
Euro3 homologation. 
New colour-scheme: a brand-new mix of black and fluorescent red.
