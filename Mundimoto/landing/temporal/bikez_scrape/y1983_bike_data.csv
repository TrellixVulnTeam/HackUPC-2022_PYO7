Honda engineers seemto have removed the last tedious, time-consuming ritual from motorcycling´s Saturday afternoon

Here is a machine that fulfills the 650 promise: it feels small, smaller than a 750, yet runs with 750s without even breathing hard. Its smoothness and comfort invite long rides. The rear suspension´s springing and damping rates do need tuning to provide a more supple ride; and for sporting riders, Honda´s engineering department should attend to the drive line´s irksome lash and shaft reaction. Having a motorcycle that needs barely more maintenance than a safetypin is a bargain only if its owner genuinely enjoys the way the motorcycle works. Diehards may complain sourly about ´appliance-like´ character, but few riders will quarrel with the way this motorcycle functions. For about six or seven years, first one manufacturer and then another has proclaimed that its 650s perform like 750s; certainly there´s been much sound to this proclamation but little real 750 fury. Now the 650 Nighthawk delivers.

Honda introduced many new ideas on this bike, but the biggest change was the style. The low seat, swept back lines, the extended forks, teardrop tank, all lent to a look that is still going strong in the Shadow of today. This was the first purpose built cruiser. The engine had a  unique offset dual-pin crankshaft that achived perfect primary balance. The Sprague (one way) clutch allowed slight slip one way to elliminate wheel chatter when down-shifting at high RPM. This bike was the debut of the three valve, twin plug head also. Hydraulic valve adjusters, electronic ignition, cam chain tensioners, hydraulically actuated clutch  and  front brakes, brushless generator, shaft drive, all were things that Honda added to make this new bike low maintenance for the rider.
