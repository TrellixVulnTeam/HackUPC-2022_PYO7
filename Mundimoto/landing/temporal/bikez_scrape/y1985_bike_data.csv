This embargo charged heavy tariffs on all imported bikes above 700 ccs. Yamaha, in an effort to keep sales up and avoid excess taxation, downsized the XJ750 and came up with the XJ700N. It had many of the same features of it´s slightly larger cousin but did not exceed the 700 cc limit. In late 1986, U.S. Courts rules the embargo illegal and cancelled it. This is why the Maxim 700 was only available in 85 and 86.

In fact some speculate it is the most prolific bike ever made. It owes its sucsess to its simplicity, cheapness and multifunctionality. It has a simple, but reasonably reliable two cilinder, two stroke engine. Has a sidecar option. Altho simple the bike is far from primitive. It has good, modern looks, for its time, it is also fairly fueleficient. This bike was intended to fill the most important role in the Warsaw-pact market-the large engine long-distance multifunctional platform (called nowadays touring, plus a bit of offroad and heavy hauling capabilities). The CZ 350 has very simple, altho fairly frequent maintenance requirements, witch if conducted properly make it virtualy imposible for the bike to give you any seruous trouble. The engine has a short life-expectancy, witch is originaly counterbalanced by the avaylability and lo-price of spare engines. It is also intended for someone to be able to change, or repair the engine in his owne backyard with only a screwdriver, wrenches and minimal expirience. The platforme is a successor of previous CZ 350 engines from the 60´s. In fact it has little more in diferant with them than looks. The original 350 of that generation-Type 472.1 came out in the 70´s. All throu to Typ 472.6, nothing changes exept suspention, an added RPM meter, a 12V alternator instead of the 6V dinamlo and some sattle, tank and taillight details. It was in production untill 1990. Altho outdated in Europe, this model is still very popular, or at least numerous in India, China and Mongoli, being used as a workhorse in rural areas, or as fast transport in cityes. The Tyo 472.6 only came in two varyations - light red eith black pinstripes or red with white stripes. Curiously the light variant had a different front fender lead for the front brake whire than the dark version.","Minor cosmetic changes over all previous models from the 472.1 to 472.5, over witch a 12V alternator upgrade and a different dashboard with anRPM gage, while all else was kept identical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This embargo charged heavy tariffs on all imported bikes above 700 ccs. Yamaha, in an effort to keep sales up and avoid excess taxation, downsized the XJ750 and came up with the XJ700N. It had many of the same features of it´s slightly larger cousin but did not exceed the 700 cc limit. In late 1986, U.S. Courts rules the embargo illegal and cancelled it.
