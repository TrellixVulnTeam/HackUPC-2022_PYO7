The U3 uses conventional motorcycle controls (handle bars, accelerator, hand brake) for both modes allowing for a seamless transition between Uno and street bike.

STAGE 1: The U3 two-wheeled configuration, referred to as “Uno mode”, utilizes two side by side parallel wheels (traction wheels) for forward/reverse movement and steering available under low operating speeds. While in Uno mode, the wheels are capable of tilting the bike while remaining parallel – providing the rider with a compact and highly maneuverable ride.

STAGE 2: The U3 three-wheeled configuration, referred to as “Motorcycle mode”, utilizes an un-motorized additional front wheel forward of the two rear wheels. As the vehicle accelerates, the front wheel deploys and transforms the U3 into a three-wheeled vehicle while moving. This mode was created to provide the rider with a safer, more stable and familiar platform for high speed travel.
