Merely a month after the decision was made to evacuate the Moscow motorcycle plant from the capital. Ahead were long years of the Second World War. Relocated factory was to produce motorcycles for the Army to fight fascists. Thus the story of the Irbit Motorcycle Factory (IMZ) began.

The motorcycle was called M72. First units rolled off the production floor just a few months after the evacuation. Altogether approximately 9.500 motorcycles were built and in use throughout the war for mobile troops, reconnaissance detachments and to carry wounded.

It was women and children in the distant Siberian factory labouring relentlessly to supply the Front with the motorcycles that defeated the enemy. Like the people who built it, the motorcycles were rugged, resilient, undefeatable. Could have they imagined that 70 years later this factory would remain the only sidecar manufacturer in the world and Ural would become a cult motorcycle¿

Since 1941 over 3 million motorcycles have been produced by the Irbit Motorcycles Factory.
